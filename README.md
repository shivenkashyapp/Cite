# Cite
My first ever C exercise - a very minimal, barebones text editor written in C, for [*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems.
No complicated keystrokes, just editing on the fly, right in your terminal.

<b>(Work in progress)</b>

# Why?
I was fascinated by [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and how powerful it is, as a text editor, and thus I wanted to make something similar.
In essence, this is just a very tiny version of [GNU Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), and even replicates its free cursor navigation.
I also really wanted to learn how low-level I/O operations work.

# Can I use it?
Yes. Not only can you use it, you can hack it and add features to your liking.
That being said, I will NOT recommend you to daily-drive this editor. It is NOT MEANT for production level usage - it is far from that.
